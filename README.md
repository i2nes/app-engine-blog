# app-engine-blog
A simple blogging platform using [Flask (a Python microframework)](http://flask.pocoo.org/) running on Google App Engine.

You can see a working demo of this repository [here](https://flask-blog-demo.appspot.com/)

The template used for this blog is [startbootstrap-clean-blog](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog)

*Work is in progress, you'll probably only see a hello world on the demo site at this time*
